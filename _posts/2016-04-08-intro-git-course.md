View the whole course here: [A practical introduction to git](http://annaken.github.io/intro_to_git_course/#/)

82 slides, about a four to six hour course. Almost every other slide is an exercise to get you really familiar with the git commands and how things fit together. I'm using Gitlab as the remote but that's just a very small segment, and really similar to Github.
