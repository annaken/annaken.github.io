I gave a talk at the recent PuppetConf called "Puppet in the Pipeline" - a round up of workflow planning, deployment pipelines, and integration points. I start out with a very basic setup, and walk through various stages of complexity, talking though technical options and things to consider. I can't seem to get it written down as a satisfactory blog post, but for now I will just link to the video and slides:
