I gave a talk at the recent PuppetConf called "Puppet in the Pipeline" - a round up of workflow planning, deployment pipelines, and integration points. <!--more-->
I start out with a very basic setup, and walk through various stages of complexity, talking though technical options and things to consider. 

I can't seem to get it written down as a satisfactory blog post, but for now I will just link to the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jXGmxkEoeMi) and [slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/AnnaKennedy11/puppet-in-the-pipeline-55953094).
