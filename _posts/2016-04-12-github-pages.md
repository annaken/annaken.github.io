Having just written a short git course using reveal.js, I was looking for somewhere to host it online, and I discovered that Github pages worked beautifully.

Basically:

* Make a new empty repository in github (don't let it do any fancy setting up for you)
* Commit the reveal.js presentation (the whole folder) to a branch called gh-pages
* The presentation should now (within a few minutes) be available at yourname.github.io/repo-name

For this repository: https://github.com/annaken/intro_to_git_course

This is the presentation: http://annaken.github.io/intro_to_git_course/#/

So easy! So pretty!
